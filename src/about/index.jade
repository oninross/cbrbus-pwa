                ol
                    li If you know where your stop is, you can tap on the marker on the map.  You will receive a notification 1 stop before the one you have selected so you can prepare yourself in alighting from the bus.
                    li You can tap the marker of the current bus stop that you are on (it is beside the blue pin) to receive a notification if the bus is 1 stop away.

                p Do take note that all information about the bus arrival is depending on the data we are grabbing from the API.  Sometimes you will be notified when the bus is on the stop itself.  Don't worry, we are working on it.
